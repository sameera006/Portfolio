## SUMMARY

This week we studied the much awaited Google Earth Engine. " [Google Earth Engine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/google-earth-engine "Learn more about Google Earth Engine from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") is a cloud-based platform that makes it easy to access high-performance computing resources for processing very large geospatial datasets. It is designed to help researchers easily disseminate their results to other researchers, policy makers, [NGOs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/non-governmental-organisation "Learn more about NGOs from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), field workers, and even the general public. Once an algorithm has been developed on Earth Engine, users can produce systematic data products or deploy interactive applications backed by Earth Engine's resources, without needing to be an expert in application development, web programming or [HTML](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/document-markup-languages "Learn more about HTML from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages")." [@gorelick2017]

It is accessed and controlled through an [application programming interface](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/application-programming-interface "Learn more about application programming interface from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (API) and an associated web-based interactive development environment (IDE) that enables [rapid prototyping](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/rapid-prototyping "Learn more about rapid prototyping from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and visualization of results. So basically GEE can load large datasets within seconds instead of downloading the big heavy satellite imagery which we did during the first three weeks of our practicals. It consist of Data Catalog which all types of Satellite imagery.

GEE has a concept of **client** and **server** side where the code which we put runs on the client side i.e. Browser so we do not run anything locally which speeds up the process. It uses **Javascript** as the programming Language.

The raster data is called **image** and the vector data is called **feature**.

A stack of images is called **Image Collection** and Feature stack (lots of polygons) is known as **Feature Collection**.

## APPLICATION

"GEE is free and allows users to write open-source code that can be run by others in one click, thereby yielding fully reproducible results. These features have put GEE on the cutting edge of scientific research. The following plot visualizes the number of journal articles conducted using different geospatial analysis software platforms" [@ballinger2024]

Here we can discuss some GEE applications along with several case studies

**Vegetation**-

The full archive of the Landsat imagery was processed within GEE to map the vegetation dynamics from 1988 to 2017 in Queensland, Australia [@xie2019]. Field observations were utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and an overall accuracy of 82.6% was reported. The authors emphasized the high computational efficiency of GEE compared to when they did the same analysis using traditional methods. The Image below accounts for different applications where GEE is used.

Long et al. [@long2019] proposed an automatic method for producing a global annual burned area maps using all available Landsat images acquired between 2014 and 2015 within the GEE cloud computing platform.

## REFLECTION

Overall this week was quite anticipated from so long as everyone was waiting to learn GEE and how to use this tool and finally when we got to work on it. it seems pretty easy and straightforward. I think the processing time is very fast as we were able to finish the practical in class otherwise if we compare it with SNAP or even R we first need to download and sort out the imagery to do the analysis which took quite some time. Today we learn how to use the aggregrate function like hoe to use the reduce function and calculate the mean, median and standard variation of the stack of images.
