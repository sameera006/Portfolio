## SUMMARY

Pre-classified data

**Dynamic World Data**- data has SR, TOA

how was it trained -

ISSUES- Blobbiness-50x50 m

Confusion Matrix

The first example of people putting their training data online- ML /Deep Learning.

For global application such data is amazing. GEE

**OBJECT BASED IMAGE ANALYSIS**

pixels -distance -

OBIA is similarity between pixels. trying to match the similar pixels.

for example - we take a RGB near-infrared 1m image. its a typical kind of image where we want to do segmentation and OBIA. we do OBIA to do clean classification. like if we classify on the mean of all the vectors inside a particular polygon we will get a solid result as opposed to classifying on individual pixels we will get a lot salt and pepper noise.

there comes also a question why do we need object based analysis to improve in signal and noise. there are thousand pixels here so we might want to turn these things into objects.

| Original Image to Classify        | Different Crop Types            | Per Pixel Classification                 |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| ![](images/image-to-classify.png) | ![](images/diff-crops-type.png) | ![](images/per-pixel-classification.png) |

we use mode reducer in neighborhood to clean the image. it will remove the single pixel outliers. we also talk about spectral gradient and can we use super-pixels to remove the salt and pepper noise.

**SNIC**- (super pixel non-iterative clustering) Seeded region growing

this makes clusters without k-means. It uses a regular grid of points (like k-means) but then assigns pixels to points through distance color and co-ordinates - it represents normalised spatial and color distances. we also have seed grid which denotes spacing in pixel. we can set square or hex grid.

Image.reduceConnectedComponents

(Simple Linear Iterative Clustering) Algorithm for Superpixel generation is the most common method regular points on the image work out spatial distance (from point to centre of pixel) = closeness to centre colour difference (RGB vs RGB to centre point) = homogenity of colours

**The SLIC algorithm works iteratively**, repeating the above process until it reaches the expected number of iterations.

sub pixel analysis/ spectral mixture analysis

VIS triangle -find single pure end member

MESMA- multiple endmember spectral analysis

Accuracy Assessment

in RS we focus on PA-producer accuracy

user's accuracy and overall accuracy

where the model is correct - true positive

true negative

where the model is incorrect- FP & FN

Kappa issues

**Supervised Classification in Remote Sensing**

In supervised classification, you select training samples and classify your image based on your chosen samples. Your training samples are key because they will determine which class each pixel inherits in your overall image.

Good approach - train and test split

-   This is simply holding back a % of the original data used to train the model to then test it at the end

what do you think of spatial autocorrelation in this sense?

OBIA is dealing with spatial autocorrelation

In ML model if we use spatial data and they have not considered spatial autocorrelation between its training and testing data then its considered too good or overfitted.
