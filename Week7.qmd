## SUMMARY

Pre-classified data

**Dynamic World Data**- data has SR, TOA

how was it trained -

ISSUES- Blobbiness-50x50 m

Confusion Matrix

The first example of people putting their training data online- ML /Deep Learning.

For global application such data is amazing. GEE

**OBJECT BASED IMAGE ANALYSIS**

pixels -distance -

OBIA is similarity between pixels. trying to match the similar pixels.

for example - we take a RGB near-infrared 1m image. its a typical kind of image where we want to do segmentation and OBIA. we do OBIA to do clean classification. like if we classify on the mean of all the vectors inside a particular polygon we will get a solid result as opposed to classifying on individual pixels we will get a lot salt and pepper noise.

there comes also a question why do we need object based analysis to improve in signal and noise. there are thousand pixels here so we might want to turn these things into objects.

| Original Image to Classify        | Different Crop Types            | Per Pixel Classification                 |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|

we use mode reducer in neighborhood to clean the image. it will remove the single pixel outliers. we also talk about spectral gradient and can we use super-pixels to remove the salt and pepper noise.

**SNIC**- (super pixel non-iterative clustering) Seeded region growing

this makes clusters without k-means. It uses a regular grid of points (like k-means) but then assigns pixels to points through distance color and co-ordinates - it represents normalised spatial and color distances. we also have seed grid which denotes spacing in pixel. we can set square or hex grid.

Image.reduceConnectedComponents

(Simple Linear Iterative Clustering) Algorithm for Superpixel generation is the most common method regular points on the image work out spatial distance (from point to centre of pixel) = closeness to centre colour difference (RGB vs RGB to centre point) = homogenity of colours

**The SLIC algorithm works iteratively**, repeating the above process until it reaches the expected number of iterations.

sub pixel analysis/ spectral mixture analysis

VIS triangle -find single pure end member

MESMA- multiple endmember spectral analysis

Accuracy Assessment

in RS we focus on PA-producer accuracy

user's accuracy and overall accuracy

where the model is correct - true positive

true negative

where the model is incorrect- FP & FN

Kappa issues

**Supervised Classification in Remote Sensing**

In supervised classification, you select training samples and classify your image based on your chosen samples. Your training samples are key because they will determine which class each pixel inherits in your overall image.

Good approach - train and test split

-   This is simply holding back a % of the original data used to train the model to then test it at the end

what do you think of spatial autocorrelation in this sense?

OBIA is dealing with spatial autocorrelation

In ML model if we use spatial data and they have not considered spatial autocorrelation between its training and testing data then its considered too good or overfitted.

Spatial Cross validation

## APPLICATION

The researchers lately have diverted themselves to a much simpler task of simplifying an image into a smaller cluster of pixels called super pixels than using traditional segmentation algorithms. Several applications such as object localization, multi-class segmentation, optical flow, body model estimation, object tracking, depth estimation took advantage of super pixels.

The algorithm to do this is Simple linear Iterative Clustering Algorithm(SLIC) but it has some limitations. It requires several iterations for the centroids to converge. It uses a distance map of the same size as the number of input pixels, which amounts to significant memory consumption for image stacks or video volumes. Lastly, SLIC enforces connectivity only as a post-processing step. So the better version of this is simple non-iterative clustering (SNIC). It is non-iterative, explicitly enforces connectivity, is computationally cheaper, uses lesser memory.[@achanta2017]

Spatial autocorrelation is inherent to remotely sensed
data. nearby pixels are more similar than distant ones. The evaluation of classification
accuracy has always been considered as an important issue in the remote sensing
community. \[\@congalton1991\]. Despite the importance attached to the accuracy
assessment protocol, a gap, sometimes a serious one, is often found between the
performance metrics of a model and the real quality of the resulting map. This
tends to reduce the confidence placed in accuracy statistics and to discredit
the true capacity of remote sensing in the opinion of the t end users. Because
of spatial autocorrelation, spectral values of close pixels are often more
similar than those of distant ones, producing falsely high accuracy metrics if
the sampling design is not used for testing. [@roberts2017]
