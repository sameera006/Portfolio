title: "Week 9- Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Data"

## SUMMARY

Today final topic was on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data

SAR is an active sensor which means a sensor which provides their own illumination. for example an active sensor sees the world as the way bats do as they emit a chirp and listen to the backscatter of an echo if something gets reflected while passive sensor (optical) sees the world as our eyes do or camera do.

Radar sensor picks up the signal reflected backscattered from the earth surface. They check the topology of the surface based on how it reflects.

Interpreting Radar Images

-   Regions of calm water and other smooth surfaces appear black, because the radar pulse reflects away from the spacecraft

-   Rough surfaces appear brighter, as they reflect the radar in all directions, and more of the energy is scattered back to the antenna.Â 

They see through weather and clouds. Different wavelengths penetrates through different surfaces used in different applications. So choice of wavelenghth is important.

The most commonly used Band in imaging is C-band with 4-8 GHz frequency.

\*\* SAR Polarization \*\*

So we have vertical and horizontal transmission and reflection.

## APPLICATION

SAR is used in tracking flooding. Area that is flooded appear darker.

## REFLECTION
