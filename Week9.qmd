## SUMMARY

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data

\"SAR instruments send pulses of microwaves toward Earth\'s surface and listen for the reflections of those waves. The radar waves can penetrate cloud cover, vegetation, and the dark of night to detect changes that might not show up in visible light imagery. When Earth\'s crust moves due to an earthquake, when dry land is suddenly covered by flood water, or when buildings have been damaged or toppled, the amplitude and phase of radar wave reflections changes in those areas and indicates to the satellite that something on the ground has changed.\"

It is an active sensor which means a sensor which provides their own illumination. For example it sees the world as the way bats do as they emit a chirp and listen to the backscatter of an echo if something gets reflected while passive sensor (optical) sees the world as our eyes or camera does.

Radar sensor picks up the signal reflected backscattered from the earth surface. They check the topology of the surface based on how it reflects.

Interpreting Radar Images

-   Regions of calm water and other smooth surfaces appear black, because the radar pulse reflects away from the spacecraft

-   Rough surfaces appear brighter, as they reflect the radar in all directions, and more of the energy is scattered back to the antenna.Â 

Different wavelengths penetrates through different surfaces used in different applications. So choice of wavelenghth is important.

The most commonly used Band in imaging is C-band with 4-8 GHz frequency.

**SAR Polarization**

So we have vertical and horizontal transmission and reflection.

SAR is used in tracking flooding. Area that is flooded appear darker. It is also used for blast damage assessment.

Here we take an example of Beirut explosion. In this case study we are developing our own change detection algorithm using pixel-wise t-test.

It is basically just a signal-to-noise ratio. So we have pre and post-event images and it calculates the difference between two sample means(signal) and divides it by the standard deviation of both samples(noise). The t-value is a measure of how many standard deviations the difference between the two mean is. We need to filter the image collection to the ascending and descending orbits, and then calculate the t-value for each orbit separately.[@ballinger2024]

The visualisation parameter corresponds the statistical significance of the change in pixel value. dark purple pixel indicate no significant change and yellow pixels indicates a significant change with 95% confidence.
