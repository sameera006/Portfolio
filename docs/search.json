    "text": "2.1 WEEK 1\nMY ONLINE LEARNING DIARY\nSummary\nSo basically, this module is all about how to learn to use remotely sensed earth observation data to make some informed decisions on environmental hazards arising from changing climate.\nWhat is remote sensing?\nAccording to NASA, Remote Sensing is acquiring information from a distance.\nSpace junk, or space debris, is any piece of machinery or debris left by humans in space. It can refer to big objects such as dead satellites that have failed or been left in orbit at the end of their mission. It can also refer to smaller things, like bits of debris or paint flecks that have fallen off a rocket. Some human-made junk has been left on the Moon, too.\n\nThe Hot topics being discussed around the world like urban green space and accessibility, Illegal logging, Forest Fire, and temperature studies.\nDifferent types of satellite imagery.\nSentinel 2\nThe main advantage of Sentinel 2 over Landsat 8 is its higher resolution (across most bands, it has higher spatial resolution, its revisit time is shorter, and it has more spectral bands). However, Landsat 8 has thermal infrared bands, which means that it can be used to measure temperature.\nLandsat 8 –its history like the origin of satellite imagery USGS -Landsat 8 has a mission to collect global data and give scientists the ability to access changes in Earth’s landscape.\nTwo types of Sensors\nPassive\nActive\nAtmospheric scattering\nAtmospheric scattering is the natural phenomenon mainly responsible for the colours we observe in the sky\nAtmospheric scattering is a natural phenomenon that can be described as the result of the interaction between sunlight and particles in the atmosphere. When we look to the sky during the day we see mostly blue, while at sunset we get a more reddish color, especially near the horizon.\nRayleigh scattering describes the behavior of light when interacting with very small particles (most of the particles present in the atmosphere). Mie scattering can be used to describe the behavior of light interacting with any kind of particles, nevertheless, it is mostly used to describe the interaction with larger particles such as haze. The core of the atmospheric scattering computational models is the method to solve the scattering equations of Mie and Rayleigh.\n\nSelf-Reflection\nWhen I think about remote sensing the first thing that comes to my mind is high-resolution images captured by satellites and we humans working on it. Be it land, water, and events like fire, floods, earthquakes, any natural disaster, or man-made disasters like war which includes bombing and destruction of houses. Everything can be recorded, and we can study it, and be aware of it for the future. It’s just like magic. Last week in the Big Data class I was fascinated to see how daily images of Gaza were available and we can see how much destruction has happened or is happening. Remote sensing gives you time-series data through which we can tell how the place has changed in all these years. How many buildings got demolished, how many trees were cut down, and how many new buildings were constructed? In my past life, I have used remotely sensed data to classify land use landcover and generate environmental impact assessment reports for work.\nAtmospheric correction-\nNow the tools are so good that imagery downloaded can be cleaned just like clean data or use .csv or .shp file for GIS work. We can remove all the bad layers. And run the software as many times to get the best clean image. Its like removing all the NaNs.\nYou can add options to executable code like this\n\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nThe echo: false option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed)."
