This is my online Learning diary.

In CASA0023 we are asked to make a portfolio that will help us in the future.

Hi! I am Sameera. I am from India and have lived in many different parts of the country. When someone ask me where in India you are from i have to think and reply as i was born in Kanpur, completed my school there and for further studies I moved to Delhi, the capital of India. and Past five years i have been moving to different cities from Ahmedabad to Kochi to Bangalore. Now here i am in London.

Reading maps has fascinated me ever since I attended cartography lessons back in school; however, I never knew that I would find my calling in the same field in the future. It is exhilarating how I followed my passion and entered the field of GIS after spending over six years working as a lecturer at an undergraduate college.

I love travelling. My favorite destination till date is Leh, Ladakh. Here's the picture from that place.![](images/WhatsApp%20Image%202024-03-12%20at%2010.54.09.jpeg)
