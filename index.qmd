This is my online Learning diary for one of my modules, Remotely Sensing cities and Environments.

Hi! I am Sameera. I am from India and have lived in many different parts of the country. When someone ask me where in India you are from I have to think and reply as I was born in Kanpur, completed my school there and for further studies I moved to New Delhi, the capital city of India and from past five years I have been moving to different cities from Ahmedabad to Kochi to Bangalore. Now here I am in London.

Reading maps has fascinated me ever since I attended cartography lessons back in school; however, I never knew that I would find my calling in the same field in the future. It is exhilarating how I followed my passion and entered the field of GIS after spending over six years working as a lecturer at an undergraduate college.

Coming to UCL and studying among the greatest minds and from the worlds best faculty seems like a dream. And I am living it.

Apart from books and studying I also love travelling. My favorite destination till date is Leh, Ladakh. Here's the picture from that place. Isn\'t it beautiful?
