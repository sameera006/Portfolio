## **CORRECTIONS**

## **SUMMARY**

This week we looked at the story of **Virginia Norwood** known as the mother of Landsat. She designed the Multispectral Scanner (**MSS**) against the good old **RBV**(return beam vidicon) sensor.

Landsat collects images in long narrow strips called "swaths." Previous Landsat sensors swept back and forth across the swath like a **whisk broom** to collect data.\
In contrast, the instruments on Landsat 8 view across the entire swath at once, building strips of data like a **push broom**. \

**GEOMETRIC CORRECTION**

Geometric distortions introduced by sensor system attitude (roll, pitch, and yaw) and/or altitude changes can be corrected using ground control points and appropriate mathematical models (e.g., Im et al., 2009). A ground control point (**GCP**) is a location on the surface of the Earth (e.g., a road intersection) that can be identified on the imagery and located accurately on a map.

There are two types of geometric correction-

-   image-to-image rectification and

-   image-to-image registration

**Image-to-map rectification** is the process by which the geometry of an image is made planimetric. The image-to-map rectification process normally involves selecting GCP image pixel coordinates (row and column) with their map coordinates counterparts (e.g., meters northing and easting in a Universal Transverse Mercator map projection).

**Image-to-image Registration**

Image-to-image registration is the translation and rotation alignment process by which two images of like geometry and of the same geographic area are positioned coincidentally concerning one another so that corresponding elements of the same ground area appear in the same place on the registered images.

**ATMOSPHERIC CORRECTION**

The two most important sources of environmental attenuation are

1\) atmosphere attenuation caused by scattering and absorption in the atmosphere, and 2) topographic attenuation.

For example, consider the case of the **normalized difference vegetation index** (NDVI) derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM ) band 3 (red) and band 4 (near-infrared) data.

A rather simple method to correct raw satellite (or any other imagery) is called **dark object subtraction(DOS)** which uses the idea that the darkest pixel within the image should be 0 and any value it has is attributed to atmosphere. so to remove it we will subtract that value from the rest of the pixels within the image.

**DIGITAL NUMBER**

First, we need to download some raw satellite data that comes in DN format. we are using Lansat 8 collection1 (or 2) level-1 bundle.

**Texture Analysis** is one of the most important characteristics dealt with during image interpretation and classification. Texture analysis has been successfully applied to forestry and vegetation studies using a variety of remote sensing data (Asner et al., 2002; Franklin et al., 2000) and radar images (Costa, 2004; Hess et al., 2003).

## **APPLICATION**

(write down some studies which has done some correction and compare it and be critical about it)

The practical content addressed corrections using raw satellite imagery, merging images, and enhancements. This application section will focus on studies that have made use of atmospheric corrections.

**Sensor**

-   Landsat (2000 to 2012)

Monitoring forest loss and illegal logging

-   Pre-processing

> "Landsat pre-processing steps included: (i) image resampling, (ii) conversion of raw digital values (DN) to top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, (iii) cloud/shadow/water screening and quality assessment (QA), and (iv) image normalization"
>
> The stack of QA layers was used to create a perpixel set of cloud-free image observations which in turn was employed to calculate timeseries spectral metrics.
