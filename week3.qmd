## **CORRECTIONS**

**SUMMARY**

This week we looked at the story of Virginia Norwood known as the mother of Landsat. She designed the Multispectral Scanner (MSS) against the good old RBV(return beam vidicon) sensor.

Landsat collects images in long narrow strips called \"swaths.\" Each swath is 185 kilometers (115 miles) wide and is 2,752 kilometers (1,710 miles) from the next adjacent swath taken that day. It takes 16 days for the swaths to overlap enough to image the whole Earth. Previous Landsat sensors swept back and forth across the swath like a whisk broom to collect data. The sensor looked at a calibration source at the end of every row, which means that measurements were consistent from orbit to orbit.

\
In contrast, the instruments on Landsat 8 view across the entire swath at once, building strips of data like a push broom. This approach requires no moving parts and gives the sensor detectors greater dwell time. The push broom instrument is smaller and lighter than previous whisk broom instruments, but its calibration is much more complex given the large number of detectors.\
\
\"It was a natural step to evolve to a pushbroom sensor. The technology was proven on other satellites, and we knew we could get better accuracy. The pushbroom has no moving parts. It is a newer and more reliable technology.\"

**GEOMETRIC CORRECTION**

Geometric distortions introduced by sensor system attitude (roll, pitch, and yaw) and/or altitude changes can be corrected using ground control points and appropriate mathematical models (e.g., Im et al., 2009). A ground control point (GCP) is a location on the surface of the Earth (e.g., a road intersection) that can be identified on the imagery and located accurately on a map.

two types of geometric correction-

-   image-to-image rectification and

-   image-to-image registration

**Image-to-map rectification** is the process by which the geometry of an image is made planimetric. Whenever accurate area, direction, and distance measurements are required, image-to-map geometric rectification should be performed. The image-to-map rectification process normally involves selecting GC P image pixel coordinates (row and column) with their map coordinates counterparts (e.g., meters northing and easting in a Universal Transverse Mercator map projection).

**Image-to-image Registration**

Image-to-image registration is the translation and rotation alignment process by which two images of like geometry and of the same geographic area are positioned coincident concerning one another so that corresponding elements of the same ground area appear in the same place on the registered images.

**ATMOSPHERIC CORRECTION**

The two most important sources of environmental attenuation are 1) atmosphere attenuation caused by scattering and absorption in the atmosphere, and 2) topographic attenuation.

Sometimes the remotely sensed data must be atmospherically corrected. For example, it is usually necessary to atmospherically correct the remote sensor data if biophysical parameters are going to be extracted from water bodies (e.g., chlorophyll a, suspended sediment, temperature) or vegetation (e.g., biomass, leaf-area-index, chlorophyll, percent canopy closure). If the data are not corrected, the subtle differences in reflectance (or emittance) among the important constituents may be lost.

For example, consider the case of the normalized dif- ference vegetation index (NDV I) derived from L andsat Thematic M apper (TM ) band 3 (red) and band 4 (near-infrared) data:

**MOSAICKING**

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
