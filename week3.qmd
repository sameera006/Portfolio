## **SUMMARY**

This week we looked at the story of **Virginia Norwood** known as the mother of Landsat. She designed the Multispectral Scanner (**MSS**) against the good old **RBV**(return beam vidicon) sensor.

Landsat collects images in long narrow strips called "swaths." Previous Landsat sensors swept back and forth across the swath like a **whisk broom** to collect data.\
In contrast, the instruments on Landsat 8 view across the entire swath at once, building strips of data like a **push broom**.\

**GEOMETRIC CORRECTION**

Geometric correction caused by sensor system attitude (roll, pitch, and yaw) or altitude changes can be corrected by ground control points(GCP).[@nguyen2015]

There are two types of geometric correction-

-   image-to-image rectification and

-   image-to-image registration

**ATMOSPHERIC CORRECTION**

The two most important sources of environmental attenuation are

1\) atmosphere attenuation caused by scattering and absorption in the atmosphere, and 2) topographic attenuation.

For example, consider the case of the **normalized difference vegetation index** (NDVI) derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM ) band 3 (red) and band 4 (near-infrared) data. A rather simple method to correct raw satellite (or any other imagery) is called **dark object subtraction(DOS)** which uses the idea that the darkest pixel within the image should be 0 and any value it has is attributed to atmosphere. So to remove it we will subtract that value from the rest of the pixels within the image.

In the practical we have selected two tiles for Cape Town. The image below shows the NDVI for Cape Town using Landsat imagery from 2022.

The focus for this weeks practical was on image enhancements such as band rationing, filter, texture, data fusion, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

In **band rationing**, the contrast between features are enhanced by "dividing the brightness values (digital numbers) in a reflectance curve after the additive atmospheric haze and additive sensor offset have been removed".

Here we have taken a smaller study area polygon from the original image in order to reduce the processing time. As running texture analysis in R takes quite a time.

PCA is basically common data reduction technique. Its is used to reduce the number of bands of multi-spectral imagery. Below is the example from this weeks practical.

## **APPLICATION**

This application section will focus on studies that have made use of atmospheric corrections. In this theme [@nazeer2021], the atmospheric correction study shows that the Simplified and Robust Surface Reflectance Estimation Method (SREM) indeed presents a promising approach to atmospheric correction in satellite remote sensing data. Its simplicity, not requiring inputs like Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), aerosol type, water vapor, and ozone, is a significant advantage. But the author should consider the assumptions are true for all conditions. Secondly validation of dataset is very crucial step. And also comparing with other models provides a more comprehensive evaluation of SREM's effectiveness. Similarly [@dong2023] study presents a compelling case for the use of the Sensor Invariant atmospheric correction (SIAC) method in correcting atmospheric effects in wide-swath GF-1 and GF-6 WFV images. The improvement in accuracy for both types of images is a significant achievement. However some limitations includes this method can be used to other types of images basically how can we make it more generalized and validation checking with other models is crucial and incorporating reflectance measurements obtained during a field campaign in the future.

## REFLECTION

Well, this week was quite interesting and intense as we learned a lot of different techniques to improve our imagery. What I understood is that when we download imagery from the satellite onto our computer the first step to use it in our analysis is to check its characteristics like the DN, and radiance value. After that, we take measures like atmospheric correction, geometric correction, fusion, and other techniques that improve the quality of imagery. Usually these days if we download any Landsat imagery or Sentinel-1 most of the corrections like DN or radinace value is already been taken care of so we do not have to check the above but it is a good practice to know all these specifics about the satellite imagery. We can always use image fusion or image enhancement and even change the texture. Well that is really cool.
